## Exercise 1

Consider to transmit a binary symbol constellation $\{1, +1\}$ through the
channel $p[n] = 0,5[n] 0,5[n - 1] + 0,8[n - 2]$.

### Question 1.1

Draw the trellis diagram labeling each branch with the corresponding metric.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'forceLegacyMathML':'true'} }%%
flowchart LR

subgraph s++ ["++"]
    s++1((" ")); s++2((" "))
end
subgraph s_+ ["-+"]
    s_+1((" ")); s_+2((" "))
end
subgraph s+_ ["+-"]
    s+_1((" ")); s+_2((" "))
end
subgraph s__ ["--"]
    s__1((" ")); s__2((" "))
end

s++1 --" 1 | 0.8"--> s++2
s++1 --"-1 | -0.2"--> s_+2

s_+1 --" 1 | 1.8"--> s+_2
s_+1 --"-1 | 0.8"--> s__2

s+_1 --" 1 | -0.8"--> s++2
s+_1 --"-1 | -1.8"--> s_+2

s__1 --" 1 | 0.2"--> s+_2
s__1 --"-1 | -0.8"--> s__2
```

Now, to find the minimum distance. Let's choose all 1's as our reference
sequence.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'forceLegacyMathML':'true'} }%%
flowchart LR

subgraph s++ ["++"]
    s++1((" ")) --> s++2((" ")) --> s++3((" ")) --> s++4((" ")) --> s++5((" "))
end
subgraph s_+ ["-+"]
    s_+1((" ")) ~~~ s_+2((" ")) ~~~ s_+3((" ")) ~~~ s_+4((" "))
end
subgraph s+_ ["+-"]
    s+_1((" ")) ~~~ s+_2((" ")) ~~~ s+_3((" ")) ~~~ s+_4((" "))
end
subgraph s__ ["--"]
    s__1((" ")) ~~~ s__2((" ")) ~~~ s__3((" ")) ~~~ s__4((" "))
end

s++1 --" 1 | d=1" --> s_+2(("1"))
s_+2 --" 1 | d=1" --> s+_3(("2"))
s+_3 --" 1 | d=2.56" --> s++4(("4.56"))
s_+2 --"-1 | d=0" --> s__3(("1"))
s+_3 --" 1 | d=0.36²" --> s+_4(("4.56"))
```

The only path back into the reference line goes through the `+-` node, and the
cost to get back is $2.56$. Since all other paths will have to use this link at some point, if their cost is higher than $4.56 - 2.56 = 2$, we can discard them.

The final node has a cost of $3.92$. Note that $D_{min}$ is the square root of
this value:

$$
D_{min} = \sqrt{3.92} = 1.98
$$

### Question 1.2

Determine the minimum distance Dmin.

## Exercise 3

A 4-PSK constellation, with equiprobable symbols $A[n] \in {+1, 1, +j, j}$ and
$E_s = 1$, is transmitted through the following equivalent discrete channel

$$
p[n] = [n] + j0.8[n - 1]
$$

with additive Gaussian white noise. The goal is to evaluate the performance of
the system with di↵erent receivers.

### Question 3.a)
If in the receiver there is a memoryless symbol by symbol detector

#### Section 3.a.i)

Obtain the received constellation without noise in the channel.

> **Answer**

| $A[n]$ | $A[n-1]$ | $o[n] = A[n] + j 0.8 A[n-1]$ |
| :----: | :------: | ---------------------------- |
| $1$    | $1$      | $1+j0.8$                     |
| $1$    | $-1$     | $1-j0.8$                     |
| $1$    | $j$      | $1-0.8 = 0.2$                |
| $1$    | $-j$     | $1+0.8 = 1.8$                |
| $-1$   | $1$      | $-1+j0.8$                    |
| $-1$   | $-1$     | $-1-j0.8$                    |
| $-1$   | $j$      | $-1-0.8 = -1.8$              |
| $-1$   | $-j$     | $-1+0.8 = -0.2$              |
| $j$    | $1$      | $j+j0.8 = 1.8j$              |
| $j$    | $-1$     | $j-j0.8 = 0.2j$              |
| $j$    | $j$      | $j-0.8 = -0.8 + j$           |
| $j$    | $-j$     | $j+0.8 = 0.8 + j$            |
| $-j$   | $1$      | $-j+j0.8 = 0.2j$             |
| $-j$   | $-1$     | $-j-j0.8 = -1.8j$            |
| $-j$   | $j$      | $-j-0.8 = 0.8 - j$           |
| $-j$   | $-j$     | $-j+0.8 = -0.8 - j$          |

#### Section 3.a.ii)

Calculate the probability of error Pe.

> **Answer**
>
> 0.28

The symbol-by-symbol detector will decide on distance, since the noise is white

### Question 3.b)
If the receiver is composed by a linear equalizer using the ZF criterion (without constrains in its complexity) and then a symbol by symbol detector

#### Section 3.b.i)

Obtain the transfer function of the equalizer.

#### Section 3.b.ii)

Estimate Pe.

### Question 3.c)
If the receiver is a ML (maximum likelihood) detector of sequences:

#### Section 3.c.i)

Obtain the trellis diagram and the minimum distance to an erroneous event.

#### Section 3.c.ii)

Obtain Pe and compare with the probabilities of error previously obtained.

## Exercise 4

### Question 4.c)

> **Answer**
>
> $$D_{min} = 0.79$$

### Question 4.d)

Decode the following sequence

$$
\bar{q} = \{0.2, -0.3, -0.3, 0.75\}
$$

using a a ML detector. Assume that $A[n] = 0$ for $n < 0$ and $n ≥ 3$
